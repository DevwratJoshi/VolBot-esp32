# esp32-servo
A collection of micropython code used to program a VolBot prototype

The Volbot prototype was produced to verify the simulations from the VolBotSims repository, found here: 
https://github.com/DevwratJoshi/VolBotSims

The VolBot prototype is made by sandwiching a PQ12 linear actuator between two 18-gon Hoberman planar linkages. The linear actuator is used to change the dimeter of the robot. The robot also has on board an APDS9960 color sensor from Sparkfun. 
An ESp32 board with micropython firmware is used for control. The code for the board is included in this repository
